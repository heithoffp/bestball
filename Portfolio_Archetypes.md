# The Bimodal Volatility Protocol: Portfolio Thesis

The **Bimodal Volatility Protocol** is an architectural framework designed to capture 0.1% outcomes in large-field fantasy tournaments. It rejects "balanced" drafting in favor of two extreme poles of capital allocation, maximizing mathematical leverage and environmental anti-fragility.

## 1. The Core Thesis: Anti-Fragility

Most drafters seek a "safe floor," resulting in mediocre rosters that cannot survive the chaos of an NFL season. This protocol embraces the **Bimodal Distribution**: we concentrate our bets at the "tails" of the risk curve. By avoiding the "mishy-middle" of roster construction, we ensure that when the league experiences high-variance shifts, our portfolio contains the specific structures positioned to dominate.

## 2. The Primary Branches (80% of Portfolio)

### **Zero RB (Target: 40%)**

* **The Logic:** Total avoidance of RB through Round 6. You are "Capital Rich" at the onesie positions.
* **Execution:** 70% of these builds must feature an **Elite QB**, often paired with an **Elite TE**.
* **Goal:** Create a "God Squad" that dominates WR and high-ceiling onesies, relying on late-round RB quantity to survive until the playoffs.

### **Hyper Fragile (Target: 40%)**

* **The Logic:** 3 RBs in Rounds 1–3, then a total moratorium on the position until Round 10+.
* **Execution:** You are "Capital Poor." You **must** go **Late QB/Late TE** (70%) to allow for a mid-round **WR Avalanche**.
* **Goal:** Solve the RB position with elite talent early, then use the mid-rounds to manufacture WR depth that rivals Zero RB builds.

## 3. The Structural Hedge (20% of Portfolio)

### **Hero RB (Target: 20%)**

* **The Logic:** Exactly one RB in Rounds 1–2.
* **Goal:** A stabilizer against seasons where a single legendary RB (e.g., 2019 CMC) breaks the slate. It uses "Core" QB/Anchor TE picks to provide a reliable but lower-ceiling alternative to the extreme poles.

## 4. Key Protocol Constraints

* **The Dead Zone No-Fly Zone:** Rounds 4–6 are for WR/QB/TE only. Drafting RBs here dilutes capital and destroys the WR ceiling. If a mid-round RB is a "must-have," he must be pulled up into a Hyper Fragile R3 slot.
* **Capital Zero-Sum:** You cannot have it all. If you spend early at RB, you *must* save at QB. If you save at RB, you *must* spend at QB.
* **The "Stop" is Sacred:** In Hyper Fragile, the discipline to *stop* drafting RBs in Round 4 is more important than the R1-3 start.

## 5. Summary Allocation Table

| Strategy | RB Count (R1-6) | QB Target | TE Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Zero RB** | 0 | Elite (R1-3) | Elite/Anchor |
| **Hyper Fragile** | 3 (Strictly R1-3) | Late (R10+) | Late |
| **Hero RB** | 1 | Core (R4-9) | Anchor |
