This is the ultimate evolution of the Bimodal Volatility Protocol. By moving to a hierarchical tree, we acknowledge the most important rule of roster construction: Capital is a zero-sum game. If you spend a 2nd round pick on a Running Back, you aren't just buying that RB; you are "selling" the opportunity to have an Elite QB. This tree ensures that your 500-entry portfolio doesn't accidentally create "Frankenstein rosters"—builds that spend too much capital everywhere and end up with no WR depth.

The Bimodal Hierarchy (RB → QB → TE)
Branch 1: Zero RB (Target: 40% of Portfolio)
Rationale: Since you have zero draft capital tied up in RB through round 6, you are "Capital Rich." You must use that wealth to secure a "God Squad" floor at the onesie positions (QB/TE) while hammering WR.

QB: Elite (70% of Zero RB builds)

TE: Elite (40%) — The "Position of Strength" build. You dominate every spot but RB.

TE: Anchor (40%) — Secure a top 6-8 TE to ensure you aren't losing points at two spots.

TE: Late (20%) — Only if you drafted 5 WRs in the first 6 rounds.

QB: Core (30% of Zero RB builds)

TE: Elite (60%) — If you miss an Elite QB, an Elite TE becomes mandatory to provide the weekly ceiling.

TE: Anchor (30%) — The balanced "Mid-Capital" build.

TE: Late (10%) — High-risk; usually requires a 3-QB/3-TE "quantity over quality" approach.

QB: Late (0%) — AVOID. Zero RB with Late QB is "Full Chaos." You have no floor and no ceiling.

Branch 2: Hyper Fragile (Target: 40% of Portfolio)
Rationale: You spent 3 of your first 4-5 picks on RB. You are "Capital Poor." You cannot afford an Elite QB or TE because your WR room will literally be empty. You must play for "Small Room" volume at onesies.

QB: Late (70% of Hyper Fragile builds)

TE: Late (80%) — The "WR Avalanche." You spend rounds 5–12 almost exclusively on WR.

TE: Anchor (20%) — A slight hedge if a mid-round TE falls past their ADP.

QB: Core (30% of Hyper Fragile builds)

TE: Late (90%) — If you take a mid-round QB (Core), you must save the TE capital for WR depth.

TE: Anchor (10%) — Dangerous; only for specific stacks.

QB: Elite (0%) — AVOID. Hyper Fragile + Elite QB leaves you with a "Dead on Arrival" WR group.

Branch 3: Hero RB (Target: 20% of Portfolio)
Rationale: The structural hedge. You have one anchor RB, allowing for a flexible "Barbell" approach where you can pick one elite onesie player, but rarely both.

QB: Core (60% of Hero RB builds)

TE: Anchor (50%) — The "Standard" Hero build.

TE: Elite (30%) — Shifting the "Elite" capital to the TE position.

TE: Late (20%) — Pushing more capital into a WR "megalab."

QB: Elite (20% of Hero RB builds)

TE: Late (80%) — If you go Hero RB + Elite QB, your TE must be late to protect WR volume.

TE: Anchor (20%) — Pushing the limits of capital.

QB: Late (20% of Hero RB builds)

TE: Elite (50%) — Using the QB savings to buy a top-tier TE.

TE: Anchor (50%) — Reliable mid-tier starters.
